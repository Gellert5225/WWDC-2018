//: ## Introduction to Solar System

 ![Solar System](solar_art.jpg)

 Our solar system is located in the Orion Arm, which is a minor arm of the giant spiral galaxy –––– **The Milky Way**
 
 Solar system consists of an average star: the sun, and 8 planets: [Mercury](Mercury), Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.
 
 All planets revolves around the sun in nearly circular orbits. The axis of rotation most planets are nearly perpendicular to the ecliptic, with the exception of Uranus, whose axis is almost parallel to the ecliptic.

/*:
 **Two types of planets:**
 1. Terrestrial Planet: *[Mercury](Mercury)*, *[Venus](Venus)*, *[Earth](Earth)* and *[Mars](Mars)*
    * They are relatively small
    * They have warm, solid surfaces
    * they are closer to the Sun
 2. Jovian Planet: *[Jupiter](Jupiter)*, *[Saturn](Saturn)*, *[Uranus](Uranus)* and *[Neptune](Neptune)*
    * They are very big planets
    * They don't have solid surfaces, they consist of layers of clouds
    * They are found in outer solar system

//: In this project, you will explore our solar system using SceneKit and ARKit.
//: -

/*:
 Each playground page consists of a `PlanetViewController` and a `PlanetScene`. The `PlanetViewController` contains all the buttons and labels, and the `PlanetScene` contains the 3D model, texture and particle system.

 Inside `PlanetViewController`, there is also a struct for creating Planet object from a JSON file.

 For more details, please see the source file on a Mac.
